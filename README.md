# Sales_Analysis_Using_Excel
This repository contains the sales analysis dashboard created using MS Excel.

Actions Taken while creating the dashboard-
Import the data: With the help of Power Query, we brought the sales data of three workbooks together into a file.
Clean the data: Applied the Cleaning techniques to the inappropriate and irrelevant data like trimming, cleaning, removing duplicates, changing data types, etc.
Append the data: Using power query, we append the customer details data that was present into 5 different tables.
Merge the data: After having the sales data and customer data, we merged these data into a single table for creating the dashboard.
Building the connections: Using power pivot, we build the connections between two datasets i.e. sales data & customer data, and product information.
Creating pivot tables: Using this connectivity logic, we built multiple pivot tables and created 7 different types of charts. 
Building dashboard: After creating these charts, we formatted and brought them onto the screen of the dashboard and added the top values using the
function known as GetPivotData. Then we added the slicers and timelines to filter out the report.

Tasks to be performed-
To find out the total shipping cost for different product categories and sub-categories we have?
To find out the total sales against different regions like Central, Central Asia, North Asia, Oceania,
Southeast Asia for multiple quarters and years?
To find the sales done against each of the categories i.e. Technology, Furniture, and Office Supplies?
To find the difference of the sum of Total Cost, Sales, and Profit?
To find the summarized information (or KPIs) of Total Cost, Total sales, Total Profit, and no. of transactions?

Insights drawn from the dashboard-
1) The shipping cost for the subcategory "tables" lying in the category "Furniture" is highest among all the categories and subcategories.
2) For the category "Office_Supplies", the sum of Total_Cost, Total_Sales and Total_Profit is highest amongst the other two categories.
